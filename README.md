# Home_Sales
This is the repo for Assignment #22 - Home Sales

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook named "Home_Sales" in which SparkSQL was used to determine key metrics about home sales data. The following steps were performed:

* Create Spark DataFrame from the dataset

* Create a temporary table of the original DataFrame

* Write several SQL queries that return: the average price for 4-bedroom homes built across the years 2010-2017; the average price for 3-bedrooms-3-bathrooms homes built across the years 2010-2017; the average price for 3-bedrooms-3-bathrooms-2-floors homes which areas are greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet, built across the years 2010-2017; the average price for homes that are greater than or equal to $350,000 according to their range view ratings (the run time for this query is shown).
  
* Create and validate a cache of the temporary "home_sales" table

* Run the last query again, on the cached temporary table, and compute the run time

* Create a partition of the home sales dataset by the "date_built" field

* Read the formatted parquet data

* Create a temporary table of the parquet data

* Run the last query once more, on the parquet temporary table, and compute the run time

* Uncache and verify the "home_sales" temporary table
